# puregym-employer-project

The scenario for this LSE Data Analyst Career Accelerator project was as follows:

The leadership team at PureGym is embarking on a comprehensive analysis to gain insights into various aspects of the business. The team wants to determine whether PureGym is offering the right group exercise timetables and product ranges to guide its business decisions. As part of this analysis, they’ve identified ten PureGym centres whose data they want you to explore. The team would also like you to recommend improvements that would help improve profitability, member experience and satisfaction – in line with PureGym’s overall mission.
